Implement a parallel library (libpp.a) that provides to the user the
interface outlined below, which supports the concept of a distributed
shared data space.  Along with the library, supply a pp.h file which
user programs can include, and which provides all necessary function
prototypes, defines e.g. PP_SUCCESS, PP_HANDLE_SIZE, etc.

Implement in C/C++.

Use MPI (mpich3) for the communication mechanism.
